# GraphProject

#this is the repository for the final data structures project

Instructions for compilation and use:
1. Open a terminal in the base folder of this repository after cloning
2. Run 'g++ -g graph/main.cpp graph/graph.cpp -o graph/main.exe' (or other compiler of choice, but we wrote and tested everything with g++)
3. Step 2 will have created the application main.exe in the graph subfolder--run this application from the terminal (or equivalent terminal with current folder set to GraphProject) by entering './graph/main.exe' and enjoy!
